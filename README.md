# Universal Logger

This documentation realase for our research results publication during the GINOP-2.1.7-15-2016-01781 tender.

This program is a data collector, which can be used to gather the measured values by sensors or etc. The devices have to use the „general” communication protocol. (Our documention contain the „general” communication protocol meaning.) Nowdays the most device is used this protocol.

The program use paramter tables. These tables necessary for configuration (for example which communication protocol should be used or set the COM port etc.). We created a default table, that editable. The parameter tables allow, that anyone can add new commands (some devices have own protocol, but these protocol follow the „general” communication protocol rules).

The project contain the C# files and the default parameter table. The executable file is generated from these files. There are 3 manual: Communication_protocol, Paramater_tables_manual and User_manual. These manuals are included the whole program working.
